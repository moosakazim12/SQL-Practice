# Question (SELF JOIN)
# How can you output a list of all members who have recommended another member? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).

SELECT DISTINCT
       m.firstname,
       m.surname
FROM cd.members m
INNER JOIN cd.members r
  ON m.memid = r.recommendedby
ORDER BY m.surname, m.firstname;
